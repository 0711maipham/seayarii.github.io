                <h2>About</h2>
                <img src="http://puu.sh/ykSpo/825b48d672.jpg" align="right" style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
                <p>
                        My name's Tonette! I'm a graduate from one of the country's top STEM universities. I'm artistically inclined, and I've been
                        holding a crayon or other drawing utensil ever since I left the womb (my motto is draw first, breath
                        second!).
                </p>
                <p>
                        I'm trained in many sciences including chemistry, animal biology, and ecology. I'm also an emerging .NET web developer with
                        JavaScript, C#, and AngularJS under my belt. My dream is to make life easier for other people. If
                        I can make the world a better place doing what I love, then I couldn't ask for more. Art, science,
                        and coding aren't mutually exclusive and I hope you can agree with me. Feel free to drop a message
                        if you'd like to share tips, stories, or just want to have a chat!
                </p>

                        <h3>Web Development</h3>
                        I'm a certified full-stack .NET web developer. I'm trained in the likes of Javascript, C#, HTML, and CSS. I have experience
                        working with Entity Framework Core, Phaser, SignalR, and the Google Maps API amongst other third-party
                        resources. I also have an eye for design, but check my portfolio out and decide that for yourself!
                </p>

                        <h3>Art and Design</h3>
                        I have been drawing for as long as I can remember. I have done freelance art and graphic design for over 6 years. My tools
                        of choice are Adobe Photoshop and FireAlpaca. I am also experienced with Adobe Illustrator and Adobe
                        InDesign.
                </p>
                <p>
                        <h3>Biology and Ecology</h3>
                        I possess a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of California. I have performed data analysis, animal model
                        care, and California coastal fieldwork. I'm also familiar with basic lab procedures and practices,
                        such as PCR. Above all else, I love nature and all animals, so if by chance you need an artist-programmer-ecologist,
                        then I can assure you I am 300% qualified!
